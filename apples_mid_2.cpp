/**
 * Solve this in C++ [90 points] A farm that produces apples faces a problem in packaging the apples in 1000 grams each package as accurately as possible. It wants to maximize its profit by not exceeding the 1000 grams as possible (the law enforces to sell by the price of 1 Kg not the actual weight) and still be fair

a) Write a C++ program that reads the number of apples and their weights in grams and outputs the number of packages and the weight of the last package.

b) Modify your program to output the weights of all the packages. The package with the maximum weight across all packages should be minimized.

Your are required to output the packages the apples on then and the total wight of every package

input:
8
200 300 150 250 400 100 350 225

output:
package 1: 200 300 150 250 100 (total weight: 1000 grams)
package 2: 400 375 225 (total weight: 1000 grams)
